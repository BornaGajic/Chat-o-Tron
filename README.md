## Chat-o-Tron :computer: :envelope: :computer:
A  local area network messaging application. Chat-o-Tron allows you to create or join any number of chatting rooms. My goal for this app is to have as many features as possible - my personal coding playground.

Current To-Dos:
 - Public/Private/Temporary rooms
 - Some sort of an account system
 - Make it run outside local network
 - Notes/Planning/Pool - client can use it in a room

At some point I'll put msi installer here.
